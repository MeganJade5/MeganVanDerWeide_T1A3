Hello Trainer!
This is the guide to the application. 

This application is an interactive data base to serve you!
We aim to give our clients the best possible sessions, so we need to know each client personally. 
By navigating through the app you will be be able to store and access your clients information.
There is an option to get some quick injury do's and dont's. 

The application will ask you to type directly into the terminal.
When this occurs, type into the terminal the answer and hit 'ENTER' on your keyboard. 

If you have troubles typing in your input, it may be that the app doesn't like it.
If this happens, the app will let you know and allow you to try again. 

There are also menus where you need to make a selection. 
Use the 'UP/DOWN' arrows to navigate through the options and hit 'ENTER' on your keyboard to confirm.

The app will start by asking you what you, as the trainer would like to do today! 
    - First option is to input a new client. Once selecting this option, 
    you will be asked to select which trainers file you would like to add the client to. 
    We have three trainers to choose from! 
    Here you will go through a series of prompts for the app to attain the data it needs. 
    Please note, if the client does not have an injury please put 'N/A' for the area of injury on the body. 
    - Secondly the app will allow for you to open a trainers file, search for a client and view said clients stored data. 
    - Thirdly the app will generate a fact sheet of "do's and don'ts" in training said injury selected
    -The app can also allow for you to update and delete the clients in each of the three trainers files. 

You can also exit the app at any time by hitting 'CTRL C' on your keyboard. This will end the app! 

Lets get training!
